            <h3 class="text white text-center text-muted">
                As an ambitious Computer Science student at Warsaw University of Technology, I am ready to leverage my academic achievements into a thriving software development career. My strong foundation in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with C++ has equipped me to design and implement efficient, scalable software systems. I excel in data visualization using SQL, turning complex data into clear insights. Passionate about artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, I've developed practical algorithms that make data-driven decisions. My web development skills, including HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and frontend frameworks, complement my backend development proficiency in Python, C, C++, and C#. With basic Linux skills, I efficiently navigate software development and deployment. A proactive learner and problem-solver, I adapt quickly to new technologies, aiming to contribute to innovative projects and drive advancements. I am eager to apply my comprehensive skill set in a dynamic team, contributing to impactful projects and continuing my professional growth.</h3>
